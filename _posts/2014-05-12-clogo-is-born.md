[Clogo](http://chopp.in/clj/clogo "Clogo") started about 18 months ago... and slept for a year until I finally decided to push it out to the world.

**Clogo is a LOGO interpreter written in Clojure.  It can control a Lego NXT2 (Mindstorms) turtle robot or be used in standalone mode.**

My motivations to write Clogo were:[![Kids learning LOGO]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2014/05/clogo-2-300x168.png)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2014/05/clogo-2.png)

- learn Clojure
- initiate my kids to programming through the LOGO language (which brought me to programming when I was in 3rd grade!)
- play with my Lego Mindstorms NXT2 set

You can find Clogo on github at: [https://github.com/japonophile/clogo](https://github.com/japonophile/clogo "Clogo, a LOGO REPL written in Clojure")

I hope to write a few posts on how Clogo was designed and what I learned while creating it.

Meanwhile, feel free to try it out, and give me feedback (file issues or propose fixes).
