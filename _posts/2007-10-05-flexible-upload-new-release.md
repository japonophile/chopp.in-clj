Here is a release 1.6 of [Flexible Upload](http://blog.japonophile.com/flexible-upload/ "Flexible Upload plugin for Wordpress"), the best image upload plugin for Wordpress in the world ;)

Full of new features, most notably multi-language support and multifile upload support. I also tried to answer some of the requests posted on the plugin page, but I must say it's difficult to decide what to do or not. (It is not because one guy or gal said he wanted feature xyz that many other people do...)

But ok, here it is. I'm waiting for your feedback!
