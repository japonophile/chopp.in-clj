Recently, I tried two web applications which I'd like to briefly review.

![Mindomo logo]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2007/10/mindomo_logo.png)The first one is **Mindomo** [http://mindomo.com/](http://mindomo.com/) A very neat tool, which allows you to write [mind maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map). Try to dump the content of your brain in a Word document, it doesn't work ;) Try to write a mind map, there's still a gap with what you think, but it is closer to what you (think you) are thinking... Mindomo is an excellent example of a [RIA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Internet_application), with an easy to use interface and some pretty features (like map sharing). And it's free..... at least for up to 7 maps (that's obviously a big limitation...)

![Teamwork Project logo]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2007/10/twproject_logo.jpg)About the other webapp I'd like to present, I'm a little less enthousiast. I am talking about **teamwork project** [http://twproject.com/](http://twproject.com/). This one has a different purpose, it is an integrated tool suite for project management. There is a downloadable version, which I didn't try, so I am only talking about the online version. First the pros: the tools has plenty of features, including task scheduling, team communication, issue management, project overview, etc. And they say it integrates with [SCRUM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28development%29) (to create project and sprint backlogs), but the wizard does not seem to be available in the online version (?). However, the main problem I see with this tool: _it's too slow_!! (again, I'm speaking of the online version). It is not responsive (no Ajax out there? too many page refresh) and the number of clicks needed to perform simple things (e.g. add a task) is too high. Otherwise, I'd really have loved this tool...

Do you know any online project management tool you would recommend?
