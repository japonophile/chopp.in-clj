Have you ever thought about a browser that would allow you to follow Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, Youtube, ... and even post to your blog instantly?

![Flock, the Social Web Browser]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2007/11/flock-logo.png)Well, you were probably dreaming about [Flock](http://www.flock.com/).  I just discovered it and it looks very nice, with all (not exactly all, but most) SNS integrated.  The twitter and media sidebars are very cool, and it has all other features a modern browser offers.

Isn't this beautiful?
