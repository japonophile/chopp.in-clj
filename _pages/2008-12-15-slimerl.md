[SlimErl](http://code.google.com/p/slimerl/ "SlimErl on Google code") is an implementation of Slim for [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/).

Slim is a new communication protocol for the Fitnesse acceptance testing framework (see http://fitnesse.org/ for details, as well as the following [intro video](http://vimeo.com/2456352 "Slim Overview")).

This extremely lightweight library allows you to run Fitnesse tests of your Erlang programs, using the Slim protocol.

You can **download** the Erlang sources [**HERE**](http://code.google.com/p/slimerl/downloads/list) on Google code.

Enjoy!

_Disclaimer: This is my first Erlang project, and I do not pretend to know either Fitnesse nor Erlang very well. All constructive feedback is extremely welcome._
